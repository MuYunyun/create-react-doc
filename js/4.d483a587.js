You donâ€™t need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.\n\nyou only install it as a package so that you can create your own website or blog. You may\n choose one of the following methods:\n\n### npx\n\n```bash\nnpx create-react-doc my-doc\n```\n\n### npm\n\n```bash\nnpm init create-react-doc my-doc\n```\n\n### yarn\n\n```bash\nyarn create create-react-doc my-doc\n```\n\nOnce the installation is done, you can open your project folder:\n\n```\nnpm install && cd my-doc\n```\n\nInside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:\n\n### `npm start` or `yarn start`\n\nRuns the doc in development mode.\nOpen [http://localhost:3000]() to view it in the browser.\n\nThe page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.\n\n### `npm run build` or `yarn build`\n\nBuilds the doc for production to the build folder.\nIt correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\n\nThe build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\n\nYour doc site is ready to be deployed.\n\n### `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`\n\nThe doc\'ll deployed to GitHub Pages rely `user`, `repo` in [config.yml](https://github.com/MuYunyun/create-react-doc##config.yml)\n\n## config.yml\n\nThere is some configuration provided for you to adjust doc sites.\n\n```bash\n# Site title\ntitle: Time Flying\n\n# Witch files to show as Menu\n## you can also set detailed dir, such as BasicSkill/css\nmenu: React,BasicSkill,Algorithm\n## set init open menu keys\nmenuOpenKeys: /BasicSkill\n\n# Github\n## if you want to show editing pages on github or deploy to GitHub Pages, you should config these arguments.\nuser: MuYunyun\nrepo: blog\nbranch: master            # the default value of branch is master\ndeploy_branch: gh-pages   # which branch to deploy.(default: gh-pages)\n# publish:                # if you want upload to gitlab or other git platform, you can set full git url in it\n\n# Available values: en| zh-cn\nlanguage: en\n```\n\n## Advanced Usage\n\n* If you not want to show some private files, you can set it in `.gitignore`, and the file\'ll be ignored to show in the docs.'}}]);
