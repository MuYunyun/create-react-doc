* [create react doc](http://muyunyun.cn/create-react-doc)

## Quick Overview

```bash
npx create-react-doc my-doc
npm install && cd my-doc
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/]() to see your doc.
When you're ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.

## Usage

**create-react-doc** is very easy to use. You donâ€™t need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

You only install it as a package so that you can create your own website or blog. You may
 choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```bash
npx create-react-doc my-doc
```

### npm

```bash
npm init create-react-doc my-doc
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn create create-react-doc my-doc
```

Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```
npm install && cd my-doc
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the doc in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000]() to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the doc for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your doc site is ready to be deployed.

### `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`

The doc'll deployed to GitHub Pages rely `user`, `repo` in [config.yml](https://github.com/MuYunyun/create-react-doc#configyml)

## config.yml

There is some configuration provided for you to adjust doc sites.

```bash
# Site title
title: Time Flying

# Witch files to show as Menu
## you can also set detailed dir, such as BasicSkill/css
menu: React,BasicSkill,Algorithm
## set init open menu keys
menuOpenKeys: /BasicSkill

# Github
## if you want to show editing pages on github or deploy to GitHub Pages, you should config these arguments.
user: MuYunyun
repo: blog
branch: main              # the default value of branch is main
deploy_branch: gh-pages   # which branch to deploy.(default: gh-pages)
# publish:                # if you want upload to gitlab or other git platform, you can set full git url in it

# Available values: en| zh-cn
language: en
```

## Advanced Usage

* If you not want to show some private files, you can set it in `.gitignore`, and the file'll be ignored to show in the docs.
